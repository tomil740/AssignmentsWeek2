            As mentioned above, the definite article "the" is used when the speaker is referring to a specific noun that is already known or is easily identifiable. For example, "the cat" or "the table." It is also used to refer to a single entity that is made up of multiple parts. For example, "the United States" or "the Milky Way."

        In addition, we use THE when our noun is unique. For example, "the sun" or "the moon". Both of these nouns are unique and can only refer to one thing, so they require a definite article.

        The definite article is also used to refer to something that has already been mentioned. For example, "I saw a cat. The cat was black." In this sentence, the speaker is referring to the same cat they mentioned earlier.
